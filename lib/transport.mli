(** [kanto_solve x y D G u v cost num_iter] computes an optimal transportation plan from
    [x] to [y] according to the cost matrix [D]. The optimal plan is stored in the matrix [G],
    and the dual optimal variables (the "prices") are stored in [u] and [v].
    Note that [D] need not satisfy the triangle inequality.

    The cost associated to [G] is stored in the reference cell [cost]. [num_iter] specifies the
    maximum number of iterations of the algorithm. [kanto_solve] also returns the
    state of the solver at the end of the process as a value of type [result_internal].

    NB: [kanto_solve] does not allocate memory. All matrices and vectors must be
    preallocated by the user.

(** [kantorovich x y d num_iter] is a wrapper around [kanto_solve] which will
    allocate all intermediate structures for you. If you plan to perform a lot
    of calls to the solver for fixed sizes of [x] and [y] you might want to
    consider using the low-level interface, to avoid reallocating
    those intermediate structures. *)
