/* This file is a c++ wrapper function for computing the transportation cost
 * between two vectors given a cost matrix.
 *
 * It was written by Antoine Rolet (2014) and mainly consists of a wrapper
 * of the code written by Nicolas Bonneel available on this page
 *          http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~nbonneel/FastTransport/
 *
 * It was then modified to make it more amenable to python inline calling
 *
 * Please give relevant credit to the original author (Nicolas Bonneel) if
 * you use this code for a publication.
