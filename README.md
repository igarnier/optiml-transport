optiml-transport - optimal transportation using the network simplex algorithm

These are some bindings to a solver for the optimal transportation problem. The solver uses the network simplex algorithm
and is reasonably efficient. The underlying c++ code was obtained through the Python Optimal Transportation toolkit (POT),
which itself used some code by Nicolas Bonneel, using some code from the LEMON library.
